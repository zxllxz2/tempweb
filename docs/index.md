Welcome to the <a href="http://lab.vanderbilt.edu/mint-lab" target="_blank">Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) lab</a> at Vanderbilt University. We are an undergradate team focusing on the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in the area of continual learning.

But wait. What is the catastrophic fogetting? Check our <a href="_projects/1_project.md" target="_blank">first project</a> which explains this term in a simple way.

We have conducted a survey on some existing methods to solve the catastrophic forgetting, including Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synapsis intelligence (SI), etc. Check our projects which contain a series of examples and experiments on those methods.

In the future, we will continue to expand our survey list and explore selective forgetting, a technique to make previously trained synapsis plastic again. Check our projects if you have interest.
