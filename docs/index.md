Welcome to the <a href="http://lab.vanderbilt.edu/mint-lab" target="_blank">Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) lab</a> at Vanderbilt University! We are an undergradate team focusing on the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in the area of continual learning.

But wait. What is catastrophic forgetting? Check our [first project](projects/1_project) that thoroughly explains this term.

We have surveyed existing methods to solve the catastrophic forgetting, including Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synapsis intelligence (SI), etc. Check our projects which contain a series of examples and experiments on those methods.

In the future, we will continue to expand our survey list and explore selective forgetting, a technique to make previously trained synapsis plastic again. For now, we are researching the masking technique, such that we fix the weights of a certain number of neurons in the model to maintain the model performance. Check our projects if you have any interest.
