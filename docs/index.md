Welcome to the [Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) lab](http://lab.vanderbilt.edu/mint-lab) at Vanderbilt University. We are an undergradate team focusing on the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in the area of continual learning.

But wait. What is the catastrophic fogetting? Check our first project which explains this term in a simple way.

We have conducted a survey on some existing methods to solve the catastrophic forgetting, including Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synapsis intelligence (SI), etc. Check our projects which contain a series of examples and experiments on those methods.

In the future, we will continue to expand our survey list and explore selective forgetting, a technique to make previously trained synapsis plastic again. Check our projects if you have interest.
